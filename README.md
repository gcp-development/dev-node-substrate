This repository is tracking Substrate's
[`polkadot-v0.9.31`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/polkadot-v0.9.31) branch.

This repository is unsuitable for a production deployment, it was developed to be a single node to support [Substrate Smart Contracts](https://use.ink/how-it-works) PoCs.

The [create](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html) [pallet-contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/polkadot-v0.9.31/frame/contracts) for [WebAssembly](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm) [smart contracts](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-smart-contracts#smart-contract-environments-are-still-maturing) were configured for this single node.
